	    	We are interested in how people learn about others.
            
        </p>

        <p>
            In this study, you will play an interactive game with eight past participants from the New York City area. These participants were recruited to participate in a research study in a previous semester. They were each given an allotment of points, which could be exchanged for money at the end of their experiment. Then they made a series of choices about whether to keep the points for themselves or to share with a future player.

        </p>

        <p>
            You will learn more about these choices in just a moment.
